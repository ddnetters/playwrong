## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Playwrong seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Regular updates on progress
- Credit in the release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Scope

While Playwrong is a satirical library designed to make tests fail, we still care about:

- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Code injection risks
- Any issue that could affect systems using this library

### A Note on "Failures"

Playwrong is designed to make tests fail. This is intentional behavior, not a security vulnerability. However, if you find a way that Playwrong could be exploited to cause harm beyond making tests fail, please let us know.

*Remember: Security failures are the one type of failure we don't embrace.*
